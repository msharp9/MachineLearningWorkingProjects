Often times it is needed to show data or data summaries, for example, display a dataframe pivot table in a ppt presentation.  Converting the data into an image is an easy way to do this.  This project gives some different methods along with their drawbacks on how to do this.


Some methods introduce whitespace into the image.  One could easily fix the extra white space issue by using the fourpoint_transform project in this repo.  Example:
```
>> python transform_example.py imgkit.png
```
