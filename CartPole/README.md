Following a tutorial on pythonprogramming.net wanted to get more familiar with reinforcement learning and gym.  CartPole appears to be the hello world of this subspace.

The best I could do was 200 seconds exactly, got it several times.  The tutorial claimed to get almost twice that, so I'm wondering if there's a difference in versions.
The answer was yes, my gym is a newer version and I needed to be running on CarPole-v1.  After updating I was easily able to duplicate results.
