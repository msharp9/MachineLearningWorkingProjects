This code was built to find a piece of paper, and then transform it to a top down image.

Example Image:
![Alt text](result.png?raw=true "Original Image w/ four point transform")

With optional document output:
![Alt text](result_doc.png?raw=true "Original Image w/ four point transform as document")
